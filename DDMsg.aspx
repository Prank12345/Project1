<b>NATIONAL PARAMEDICAL COUNCIL AND VOCATIONAL BOARD SKILL DEVELOPMENT, INDIA</b> is a Non-Profit organization. This serves as center point of its all programs and activities. It focuses on Education and Training for women and child. Career counseling for holistic development and facilitating gainful employment after vocational training to youth and woman is integral part of our programs. We give importance or primarily focus on providing better education facilities & assistance to the deprived children and woman. With the support of our volunteers, partners, we have been able to provide these facilities and assistance to children, woman and the other needy people of society. Our programs provide an innovative experience where students work on cutting-edge, industry-sponsored projects.
I have read from UNFPA that Education is one of the most important means of empowering women with the knowledge, skills and self-confidence necessary to participate fully in the development process. More than 40 years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserted that "everyone has the right to education". In 1990, Governments meeting at the World Conference on Education for All in Jomtien, Thailand, committed themselves to the goal of universal access to basic education. But despite notable efforts by countries around the globe that have appreciably expanded access to basic education, there are approximately 960 million illiterate adults in the world, of who two thirds are women. More than one third of the world's adults, most of them women, have no access to printed knowledge, to new skills or to technologies that would improve the quality of their lives and help them shape and adapt to social and economic change. There are 130 million children who are not enrolled in primary school and 70 percenthem are girls. 
<br />
        We always work for better education opportunities for every woman of our nation, our students have made an Indelible mark in the field of Information Technology and made us proud.
